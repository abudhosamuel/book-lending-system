Book Lending System

1. Problem Statement
Managing borrowed and lent books can quickly become confusing, especially when multiple transactions occur simultaneously. 
Users often forget who theyâ€™ve lent books to, the return date, or even which books they still have on loan. 
This lack of organization can result in books being lost, not returned on time, or mixed up between multiple borrowers. 
Libraries, personal collections, and informal lending among friends and family require an efficient way to track book lending and borrowing.

2. Solution
The Book Lending System is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help individuals or small libraries efficiently 
track books that are lent out or borrowed. It allows users to add books, track borrowers, set due dates, and monitor whether books have been returned. 
This system solves the issue of misplaced books and missed return deadlines by providing an organized database that records all lending transactions, 
making it easy to see which books are out, who has them, and when they are due for return.


3. Features

1. Add a New Book
      Users can input the title and author of the book. 
      Input validation ensures that the book title and author contain alphabetic characters and are not purely numeric.

2. View All Books
      Users can see all the books available in the library, whether they are currently available or lent out.

3. Lend a Book
      Users select a book by ID, input borrower details (name and contact information), and specify a due date. 
      If the borrower does not exist in the system, they are added automatically.

4. Return a Book
      Users select an active transaction (a book currently lent out) and mark it as returned, updating the system and making the book available for lending again.


5. View Borrowers
      Shows borrower details along with the borrowed books and due dates. Automatically removes borrowers who have returned all books.

6. Edit Borrower Details
      Users can modify a borrower's name, contact information, or the due date of a borrowed book. This helps in keeping borrower information up to date.

7. View Overdue Books
      Checks all active transactions and displays books that are past their due date, along with borrower details, number of days overdue, and the total fine.

8. Search Books
      Users can enter a keyword, and the system will display all books that match the keyword in either the title or the author fields.
